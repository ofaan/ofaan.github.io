                    <p>There are a lot of students in our society who are very excellent in their studies but are unable to presume their aims and dreams just because of financial constraints. Students who come from financially backward families are most often stranded in the middle their paths. We help them to achieve their high aims and achievements. OFAN wishes to give a helping hand by giving them financial, moral and social support. We find it duty bound to assist these bright students until they achieve their final goal. Be it a degree in Medicine, Engineering, Indian Administrative   Service or study other technical courses.</p>

                    <p>Each and every day we hear of old people thrown away from their homes by families when they are of no use to others. A time comes in a man’s life when he is unable to help others physically and financially. Many incidents have occurred in our   surroundings where old people become homeless and destitute. OFAN wishes to take care of these people and give them shelter and loving care. In the same way due to unavoidable circumstances some people go below poverty line and find it hard to make both ends meet. They do not have even a place to dwell. OFAN would like to extend a helping hand to make small shelters for such people.</p>
