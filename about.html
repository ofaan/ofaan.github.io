                <p>The trust was formed with the intention of giving a helping hand to people who are in need  are suffering in one way or another, for instance old people who are left alone by family or fate who are in need of food, clothing and shelter. Organisation aims to assist people who are below poverty line by giving whatever help they need from time to time like medical attention, medicines and meeting other health problems. Organisation aims to help students who excel in their studies but are unable to continue their studies due to financial constraints and to assist financially throughout their studies and also give moral support.</p>

                	<p>In the beginning the trust conducted many activities. Gave medicines regularly to some aged people according to their Doctors advice. The trust was fortunate enough  to support a medical student in his first year. A girl Suraja from Vatakara stayed at the settler’s house and joined in the school of arts to learn drawing and painting. She is now an excellent artist. There was an Engineering student who was assisted by us. She is at present working in Australia.</p>
                    <p>The trust members meeting was not held for 9 years. Jayasree Kallat the settler could not hold meeting from 2008 onwards as she was appointed as jury member in CDRF (Consumer Disputer Redressal Forum) Kozhikode. John Thomas Vettoor had gone abroad as he got a job there. Nandi Dinesh also could not attend meetings as she had settled in Bangalore. Jameela Kabeer had expressed her inability to attend meetings due to her health problems. After a meeting held on 10th January 2015, decided to delete those members who had expressed their inability to attend meetings. At the same time Vijith, Sayooj and Sethunath had expressed their willingness to join the trust. With the help of the 3 new members we decided to renew the activities of the organisation with new vigour and vitality. We have started new projects by sponsoring 2 high school students, giving medical aid monthly to a patient Gangadharan who had undergone surgery for brain tumour and is now paralysed.</p>
